# Review Based Star Ratings Prediction on Yelp dataset

## Summary
The aim of this project is to predict the star ratings based on users' reviews. In the 1.0 version, I've worked with 5-star classification. In the 2.0 version, I've been left with 3-star classification problem, after I've merged the 1 and 2-star classes, and 4 and 5-star classes.

You can walk through the V-1.0 analysis [here](https://github.com/qarchli/Review-Based-Rating-Prediction/blob/master/Review%20based%20rating%20prediction-V1.0.ipynb). 
The V-2.0 is to be found [here](https://github.com/qarchli/Review-Based-Rating-Prediction/blob/master/Review%20based%20rating%20prediction-V2.0.ipynb)

## Dataset

In this project, I've used a filtered version of the [Yelp Open Dataset](https://www.yelp.com/dataset) 'review' file, which includes only reviews of businesses in 'Cleveland'.
