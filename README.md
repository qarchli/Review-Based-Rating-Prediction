# Review Based Star Ratings Prediction on Yelp dataset

## Summary
<br/>The aim of this project is to predict the star ratings based on users' reviews.<br/>
<br/>In the 1.0 version, I've worked with 5-star classification.<br/>
<br/>In the 2.0 version, I've included the 'useful', 'funny' and 'cool' columns, that are integers representing useful, funny and cool votes that each review has received, as I've been left with only a 3-star classification problem, after I've merged the 1 and 2-star classes, and 4 and 5-star classes.<br/>
<br/>You can walk through the V-1.0 analysis [here](https://github.com/qarchli/Review-Based-Rating-Prediction/blob/master/Review%20based%20rating%20prediction-V1.0.ipynb). <br/>
<br/>The V-2.0 is to be found [here](https://github.com/qarchli/Review-Based-Rating-Prediction/blob/master/Review%20based%20rating%20prediction-V2.0.ipynb)<br/>

## Dataset

In this project, I've used a filtered version of the [Yelp Open Dataset](https://www.yelp.com/dataset) 'review' file, which includes only reviews of businesses in 'Cleveland'.
